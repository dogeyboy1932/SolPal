3. **edit_person_node**: Update contact information, wallet addresses, notes, tags
4. **edit_event_node**: Modify event details, add/remove attendees, update logistics
5. **edit_community_node**: Manage community members, settings, and properties
6. **list_available_tools**: Get comprehensive tool list and usage examples

### Advanced Workflow Examples

#### Complex Multi-Tool Scenarios
1. **"Create a crypto meetup and invite Bob"**
   - create_event_node ‚Üí search_nodes ‚Üí edit_event_node
   - Full event lifecycle with contact integration

2. **"Update Alice's wallet address and add her to the DeFi community"**
   - search_nodes ‚Üí edit_person_node ‚Üí search_nodes ‚Üí edit_community_node
   - Contact management with community integration

3. **"Create a gaming community and add my gaming contacts"**
   - create_community_node ‚Üí search_nodes ‚Üí edit_community_node
   - Community creation with bulk member management

#### Enhanced Financial Workflows
- Pre-transaction validation and balance checking
- Contact-based transaction flows
- Transaction preview and confirmation patterns
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

### Improved AI Guidance

#### Error Handling Enhancements
- **Node Management Errors**: ID validation, permission checks
- **Event Errors**: Date validation, venue conflicts
- **Community Errors**: Member limit checks, privacy settings
- **Contact Errors**: Duplicate detection, data validation

#### Smart Suggestions
- **Contextual Recommendations**: Based on user activity patterns
- **Cross-Category Suggestions**: Link contacts, events, and communities
- **Proactive Guidance**: Suggest related actions and optimizations
- **Security Awareness**: Privacy and permission considerations

#### Context Awareness Improvements
- **Conversation Memory**: Track created entities within session
- **Relationship Mapping**: Understand connections between contacts, events, communities
- **Activity Patterns**: Learn from user preferences and behaviors
- **State Management**: Remember transaction histories and balances

### Security and Best Practices

#### Enhanced Security Guidelines
- **Transaction Security**: Multi-step validation and confirmation
- **Data Privacy**: Careful handling of personal information
- **Community Management**: Permission-based member management
- **Event Privacy**: Appropriate visibility and access controls

#### Best Practice Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with previews, then execute
- **Validation Chains**: Verify before acting
- **User Confirmation**: Clear consent for important actions
- **Rollback Strategies**: Guidance for correcting mistakes

### Technical Implementation

#### System Instruction Structure
```typescript
systemInstruction: {
  parts: [{
    text: `Enhanced instructions with:
    - 16 tool categories and descriptions
    - Multi-tool workflow examples
    - Comprehensive error handling
    - Security and best practices
    - Context-aware guidance`
  }]
}
```

#### Tool Organization
- **Logical Grouping**: Related tools grouped by function
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Primary and secondary tool categories
- **Usage Patterns**: Common combinations and sequences
- **Complexity Levels**: From simple to advanced operations

## Success Criteria Met
